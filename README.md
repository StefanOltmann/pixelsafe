PixelSafe is a steganography tool for PNG images that uses the Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm.

It lets you embed hidden data inside PNG files - for example, storing a KeePass database inside a screenshot.
You can use it to hide backup files, send private messages, embed digital signatures, or attach invisible metadata to your images.
