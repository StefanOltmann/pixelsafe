# PixelSafe

[![Kotlin](https://img.shields.io/badge/kotlin-2.1.20-blue.svg?logo=kotlin)](httpw://kotlinlang.org)

PixelSafe is a steganography tool for PNG images that uses the Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm.

It lets you embed hidden data inside PNG files - for example, storing a KeePass database inside a screenshot.
You can use it to hide backup files, send private messages, embed digital signatures, or attach invisible metadata to your images.
